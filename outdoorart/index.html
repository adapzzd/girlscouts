<h1>Outdoor Art</h1>

<h2>1. Explore outdoor art</h2>

<p>I went to <a href='https://jcpublicart.com'>Founders Park</a> and looked at outdoor statues.</p>
    
<p>My favorite sculpture was The Feather by Kirk Seese. I like how all the colors stand out from the black outline. I am also surprised that they can make the colored portions look like stained glass but are just plywood, acrylic paint, and epoxy resin. This one was my favorite because it was the only sculpture in the park using lots of colors.</p>

<h2>2. Make something</h2>

<p>I made a stop motion called the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anRz1ghLKbg'>Spruce Cone Ballet</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Find music in nature</h2>

<p>I made a rain stick with a leaf pattern design.</p>

<h2>4. Be a nature photographer</h2>

<p>I went to Founders Park and took photos of statues, flowers, and a very bouncy puppy!</p>

<h2>5. Design with nature</h2>

<p>I made a salt dough Christmas ornament with leaf, berry, and pinecone impressions.</p>
