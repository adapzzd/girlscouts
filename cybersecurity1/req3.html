<h1>What are protocols?</h1>

<p>What is a protocol? Let's start with the dictionary definition.</p>

<p>1A. The forms of ceremony and etiquette observed by diplomats and heads of state</p>
<p>1B. a code of correct conduct</p>
<p>2. The first copy of a treaty or other such document before its ratification.</p>
<p>3. a preliminary draft or record of a transaction<p/>
<p>4. the plan for a course of medical treatment or for a scientific experiment</p>
<strong>5. a standard procedure for regulating data transmisstion between computers</strong>

<p>For this badge requirement I used the <a href='https://www.girlscouts.org/en/girl-scouts-at-home/grade/juniors/junior-cybersecurity-basics-badge-activity.html'>Junior Cybersecurity Basics Badge Activity</a>.</p>

<p>Q1: Why do you think protocols are important in computers?</p>
<p>A1: They are important because if the computers don't follow the same protocols, they won't be able to communicate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Q2: Where else do you see protocols in everyday life?</p>
<p>A2: These are protocols that I use: grammar and adressing an envelope.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Q3: When else might protocols be useful?</p>
<p>A3: Protocols would be useful when:</p>
<ul>

    <li>raising your hand in class</li>
    <li>following a recipe</li>
    <li>sewing (with measurements)</li>
    <li>filling out a form</li>

</ul>

<p>Here is a protocol I made:</p>

<p>request protocol: [bread number], [spread number], [filling number]</p>
<p>response protocol: sandwich</p>

<p>Instructions: To fill out the request protocol, pick 3 numbers from 1 to 6. To fill out the response protocol, map the  numbers onto the chart (below) and return a sandwich (or a picture of a sandwich) using that bread, that spread, and that filling.</p>


<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Die Number</th>
        <th>Bread</th>
        <th>Spread</th>
        <th>Filling</th>
    </tr
    <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>white bread</td>
        <td>butter</td>
        <td>corned beef</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>wheat bread</td>
        <td>peanut butter</td>
        <td>lettuce</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td>whole grain bread</td>
        <td>jelly</td>
        <td>pickles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>bagel halves</td>
        <td>mayonaise</td>
        <td>cheese</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>5</th>
        <td>gluten-free bread</td>
        <td>mustard</td>
        <td>chicken salad</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>6</th>
        <td>toast</td>
        <td>bbq sauce</td>
        <td>apple slices</td>
    </tr>

<p>For example, let's say that the request protocol was 5, 1, and 3. The response protocol would be a pickle and mustard sandwich on white bread.</p>
