<h1>Networks</h1>

<h2>What is a network?</h2>

<p>A network is a group or system of interconnected people or things. For this badge requirement, we will be talking about <b>computer networks</b> (for example, the internet), which are made up of servers, routers, switches, and devices (phone, tablet, laptop, etc).</p>

<p>When you look up a webpage on your laptop, tablet, or phone, you are sending a request to the website's server. When you search for a website, you type in the URL, but that is linked to the website's IP address in the DNS (the domain name server), a bunch of computers that store websites' domain names along with their IP addresses. The DNS is a network itself!</p>

<p>Each device (server, computer, router, etc.) has a unique IP address. An IP address is like a normal address that you use to send a package to someone. Instead of a country, city, state, etc. the IP address has four numbers. The switches use those numbers to pass on the information.</p>

<p>When you send a request, your computer doesn't connect directly to the server. The request passes through multiple switches that lead your request to the correct server.</p>

<h2>How is data delivered?</h2>
<p>Because there's so much data moving around the internet, some of it's bound to get lost. But when you use a protocol called TCP, you can make sure that it's all there!</p>
