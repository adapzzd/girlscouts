<h1>What is a network?</h1>

<p>A network is a number of connected computers or machines. A network is made up of servers and routers. </p>

<p>When you look up a webpage on your laptop, tablet, or phone, you are sending a request to the website's server. When you send the request, your computer doesn't connect directly to the server. It passes through multiple routers that lead your request to the correct server.</p>
