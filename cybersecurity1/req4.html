<h1>TCP and Computer Protocols</h1>


<p>When you try to download a song, image, or other file, you are sending a request to the server that the website you 
want to download is on. When the server gets that request, it sends the thing you want to download back in something 
called a packet. If the thing you want is big (like a video or song) it will break it up into multiple packets, 
send them back, and will be reassembled using a protocol called TCP, transmission control protocol. The TCP 
protocol is for making sure all of the packets are there and putting them in order. If some packets are missing, 
the server sends back those packets.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that you want to download an image from CybersecurityIsGreat.com:</p>
<img src="downloadimage.jpg" />
<p>When you click the 'download' button, you send a request to the server of CybersecurityIsGreat.com. 
Let's just say that the IP address for the website is 12.345.678.90. Switches locate the server with the IP address 
12.345.678.90 and send the request. The server will send the data in multiple packets back to your computer.</p>

<p>Finally, when all of the packets get to your device, your browser,  using the TCP protocol, makes sure all of the 
packets are in order and are all there.</p>

<p>Oh No! One of the packets is missing! Now, your browser, using the TCP protocol, will tell the server to send 
a replacement.</p>

<p>Once all of the packets are there, the image will be downloaded!</p>
