<h1>Girl Scouts: Space Science Investigator badge</h1>
<p>Venture through the Solar System and beyond, and see that space is even bigger than you may have imagined.</p>
	<h2>Model the Solar System</h2>
	<p>I made <a href="planetmodels.html">two models</a>.</p>
	<h2>Circle the Sun</h2>
	<p>I have not done this yet.</p>
	<h2>Discover the stars</h2>
	<p>My troop and I went to the local planetarium to learn <a href="Planetarium.html">about the solar system and light pollution</a>.</p>
	<h2>Use the tools to explore</h2>
	<p>I have not done this yet.</p>
	<h2>Share your sky</h2>
	<p>I went to the observatory with my mom and dad and listened to a talk about life on other planets.</p>
