<p>On Saturday, my mom, my dad, and I went to the observatory at ETSU. In front of the building, there were three telescopes that were pointing at the Moon, Venus, and the Orion Nebula. </p>

<p>After a while, we went inside and listened to a lecture about the possibility of life on other planets. The lecturer listed things you need to have life:</p>
<ul>

	<li>Liquid (doesnâ€™t have to be water, liquid helps compounds move around so they can join together to make a complex structure) </li>
	<li>Temperature range (so the liquid is possible)</li>
	<li>Atmosphere (to protect the planet from solar wind)</li>
	<li>Magnetic field (to make an atmosphere)</li>
	<li>Carbon (has the ability to form long chains)</li>

</ul>
