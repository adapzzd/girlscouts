<h1>Trip to the Observatory</h1>

<p>Yesterday I met my Girl Scout Troop at the ETSU planetarium. We learned about the constellation Ursa Major. The myth about Ursa Major is that Zeus fell in love with a princess, but the princess' mother got mad, so she turned her into a bear. Zeus felt sorry for her, so he put her in the sky so no hunters could kill her. He needed a lot of momentum to get her so high, so he swung her by her tail and that is why her tail is so long.</p>

<p>We also learned that the Netherlands and China put a giant telescope on the dark side of the moon pointing out so we will be able to see galaxies farther away. The telescope is on a satelite and is always on the dark side of the moon.</p>

<p>Finally, we watched a short video clip about light pollution. Light pollution is making our skies brighter and making us less able to see the stars because all of the light we are making is bouncing off the atmosphere. It also hurts humans and animals. It hurts humans because it messes up our sleep cycle and causes us to stay up way too late. Baby sea turtles mistake the light for the sun sparkling on water and crawl further inland. Some ways to fix light pollution are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Directing light down to the ground and not up</li>
	<li>Putting out unnecessary light</li>
	<li>Only putting light where you need it</li>
</ul>
