<p>Next, put the dishes in a large par and fill it with boiling water. Then bake in a 325Â° oven for 30 to 45 minutes. If the flan forms a skin on top, then put a sheet of foil over the custard dishes and cook for a little while longer.</p>

<p>When the flan cools, cut around the edges of a custard dish and place a plate upside down on top. Turn the whole thing over and shake. After a couple shakes, remove the custard dish. The flan should come out.</p>
