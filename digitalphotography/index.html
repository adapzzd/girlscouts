<h1>Digital Photography</h1>

<h2>1. Learn about digital cameras from an expert</h2>

<p>I watched some videos from the Linkedin Learning course <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-photography/introduction?u=57690273'>Introduction to Photography</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Take tons of photographs</h2>

<p>I took photos during a trip to Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>

<h2>3. Edit 3 photos</h2>

<p>I edited 3 photos that it took in New Mexico:</p>

<h3>Before | After</h3>

<h2>4. Make a digital photo project</h2>


<p>I made a <a href='https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0v9CmB6tpG-d0OhQOVsX_61Yw#Albuquerque_Photo_Book'>photo album</a> from all the photos I took in New Mexico.</p>

<h2>5. Share your photos</h2>

<p>I am fulfilling this requirement by sharing my photo album with you! I will also make a Shutterfly photo book for my grandparents too.</p>
