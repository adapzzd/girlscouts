<h1>Girl Scouts: Geocaching Badge</h1>

<p>Find out about geocaching. You'll search for treasure chests, called "geocaches," using a device called a GPS receiver. When you've earned this badge, you'll know how to have a geocaching adventure.</p>

<h2>1. Prepare for your adventure</h2>

	<p>My mom and I set up an account on <a href="https://geocaching.com">geocaching.com</a> where my username is "hiddenpika". 
		I also learned about geocaching on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2>2. Learn to use a GPS receiver</h2>

	<p>I used Apple Maps and the Geocaching app to locate a geocache.</p>
	
<h2>3. Make a trade item</h2>

	<p>I made some pins, and left one in a geocache in my neighborhood.</p>

<h2>4. Go on a geocaching adventure</h2>

	<p>I went on several adventues in Utah, Nevada, and Tennessee. 
		<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx">Many times I forgot to BYOP, and had many DNFs!</a> 
		My favorite find was in a Little Free Library; it's the best way to not get caught by muggles.</p>	
	
<h2>5. Take part in a bug's travels!</h2>

	<p>I found a Geocaching.com Tracker on a hiking trip in Tennessee, and planning to take it across the country.</p>
