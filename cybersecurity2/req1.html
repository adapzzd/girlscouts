<h1>Create and Protect a Username</h1>

<p>To make a secure username, you should make it easy to remember and not have any personal information in it. It would also be good for your username to be short and easy to type, so you don't have to type in so much when you want to log in. A good format for usernames would be an adjective, a noun, and 4 random numbers. An example is 'awesomedog5926'.</p>

<p>For example, if my name were Urna Semper and I lived at 123 Number Lane, a bad username would be 'urnasemperatnumln' but a good one would be 'fluffywalrus4ever'.</p>

<p>I have created usernames, but I am protecting them by not putting them online and not telling them to anyone.</p>

<p>Here are some tips on picking a username:</p>

<ol>
    
    <li><b>Don't</b> use your full name or parts of your address or phone number or birthday or any other personal information.</li>
    <li><b>Don't</b> use your email as a username if you can avoid it – people can figure out your name from that.</li>
    <li><b>Don't</b> use the same username for different accounts – it makes you easer to track.</li>
    <li><b>Don't</b> use a username that gives hints to your password (username 'knock_knock', password 'whosthere').</li>
    <li><b>Do</b> think carefully when choosing a username. You might not be able to change it later and people may see your username online.</li>
    
</ol>
