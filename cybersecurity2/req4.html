<h1>Find Out How Information Online can Last Forever</h1>


<h2>What types of things last forever online?</h2>

<p>Everything. Everything online lasts forever. Even old versions of websites last forever. I used the <a href='https://archive.org/web/'>Wayback Machine</a> to view an <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20000619112042/http://www.girlscouts.org/'>old version of the Girlscouts website</a> and compared it to the <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20200331220013/https://www.girlscouts.org/'>more recent version</a>. You might be farmiliar with Snapchat. Snapchat's privacy policy says that after 30 days, your messages are completely deleted, even from Snapchat's server. But someone could easity save that message by taking a screen photo of your chat. Then, they could post it online or save it to their photos, and then it really will last forever. So, everything lasts forever online. That is why you should always think before you post, even if it will be 'deleted' by Snapchat or another company.</p>
