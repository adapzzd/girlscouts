<h1>Create and Protect a Password</h1>


<h3>How do I Make a Good Password?</h3>

<p>When you create a password, you should make sure that they are long and contain all sorts of characters. They should also not be related to your username. For example, the password 'monk3yz4EVR&EVR!' would be a good password because it is easy to remember, long, and uses lots of different characters. The password 'monkeysforever' would not be as good because it doesn't use that many characters (only 10), whereas the other password had more (13). The first password was longer (16) then the second (14).</p>
