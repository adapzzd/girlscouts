<h1>Create and Protect a Password</h1>


<h3>How do I Make a Good Password?</h3>

<h3>How to make a strong password</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Make your passwords long (minimum of 12 characters).</li>
	<li>Avoid using words from the dictionary.</li>
	<li>Don't use obvious letter replacements ($ for S, @ for a, 3 for E).</li>
	<li>Don't use the same password for multiple accounts.</li>
	<li>Avoid using personal information because what you post on the app might give clues to your password (ex. you make posts about your dog Woofy so hackers try a password with 'woofy' in it).</li>
	<li>Make sure your passwords have not been compromised. Go to <a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">haveibeenpwned.com</a> to make sure.</li>
	<li>Use a long sentence or phrase that is easy to remember and hard to guess (like '6SillySlimySnakezSleepSoundly').</li>
	
</ul>

<h3>How to keep your passwords safe</h3>


<ul>
	
	<li>Use a password manager (like <a href="http://lastpass.com">lastpass.com</a> or <a href="http://1password.com">1password.com</a>).</li>
	<li>Change your passwords every 90 days if you do not use a password manager.</li>
	<li>Don't use password hints.</li>
	
</ul>



<h3>Should I use a password generator website?</h3>

<p>No! Go to <a href="req3.html">my next badge requirement</a> to find out why. Also, make sure to visit the <a href="badusernamegenerator.html">Evil Password Generator</a> 'website'.</p>
