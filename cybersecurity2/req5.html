<h1>Who Can I Trust Online?</h1>

<h2>Learning Information Online</h2>

<p>When you are looking for legitamate information online and go to a website, there are a few things you should check for:</p>

<ul>

    <li>spelling mistakes</li>
    <li>low resolution images</li>
    <li>strange web adress</li>

</ul>

<p>If the website has those things, it <b>is not</b> reliable. If it is stating facts, look for a bibliography and reasearch the author, publisher, and content. If it has a bibliography, check those sources. If it is a business website, then check for an address and a phone number listed somewhere and cross-check it on a search engine. Also look for a privacy statement.</p>

<h2>Being Social Online</h2>

<p>Don't talk to anyone online without speaking to your parents first, and don't share personal information. Someone might be trying to pose as someone you know to get you to give them your personal information.</p>
