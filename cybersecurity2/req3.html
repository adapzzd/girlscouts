<h1>Discover How You Share Information and What to Share</h1>

<h2>What Information Should I Not Share?</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of rules you should follow when sharing online:</p>

<ul>

    <li><b>Never</b> post any personal information.</li>
    <li><b>Always</b> reread what you write before you post it. Things that you post last forever online.</li>
    <li><b>Always</b> make your posts short and easy to understand/</li>
    <li><b>Never</b> use all caps (unless you really mean it). All caps is usually interpereted as screaming. I reccomend not using caps unles it is a positive message (like 'That video is AWESOME!!!').</li>
    <li><b>Always</b> think before friending someone online because all you know about them is what they tell you (It's probably a good idea to only friend people that you know).
</li>
    <li><b>Never</b> impersonate other people online.</li>
    <li><b>Always</b> think about who sees your message when posting in a group chat or sending a message to multiple people.</li>

</ul>
