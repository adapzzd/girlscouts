<p>On MLK day, my mom, my brother, and I picked up litter near Brush Creek. We took photos of most of the pieces of litter we picked up.</p>

<p>I made a map with the photos we took: </p>

<hr />

<p>By picking up that litter, I was helping animals that lived by the creek, like muskrats, fish, herons, and turtles, just to name a few. Those animals could eat the litter, mistaking it for food. Even pets set loose to roam around might gobble down something. Even if the animals by the creek don't eat it, it will float into the ocean, and the sea animals might eat it. Styrofoam dissolves into little pellets after a while and might be eaten by small fish, and plastic bags might be eaten by sea turtles.</p>

<p>Even if you don't care about animals, litter can affect you too. If everyone litters, everything will look gross and dirty. You could also get sick from touching litter and forgeting to wash your hands. If styrofoam pellets are eaten by a fish, the fish might get caught by a fisherman and you might get styrofoam in your food. </p>
