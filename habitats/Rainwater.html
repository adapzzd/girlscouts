I made a rain bucket for putting rainwater into my fish tank. That way, my fish tank will become a real habitat with rainwater in it. Rainwater is better for fish because it doesn't have any chemicals in it. I had noticed earlier that some of my plants in the aquarium were dying because of the chemicals in the water.</p>

<p>List of Supplies for Rain Barrel</p>

<ul>
<li>1 inch wide PVC tubing</li>
<li>1 inch wide PVC elbow</li>
<li>Fine netting</li>
<li>5 gallon plastic bucket</li>
<li>Silicone caulk</li>
<li>Downspout tray for extra water</li>
<li>Twine</li>
</ul>

<p>This project wasn't all too hard, and it worked pretty well. </p>

<p>First, I drilled a 1 1/2 inch hole with a hole saw in the rim of the bucket. Next, I put the one piece of PVC into the hole, attached the elbow so it pointed down, and attached the other piece of PVC pipe. That was so the bucket overflows.</p>

<p>Then, I put the netting over the top of the barrel and tied it with twine. Finally, I positioned the rain bucket under the downspout to catch water. </p>
