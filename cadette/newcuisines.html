	<h2>1. Make a dish from another country: Masala Dosas</h2>
	
	<p>A dosa is like a flat, crispy pancake, originating from Southern India. A dosa can be eaten with a potato dish called Aloo Masala. A dosa is made by soaking rice, black gram (a type of bean), and fenugreek seeds in water and blending them until you get a smooth batter, and then frying it like a pancake. A dosa is supposed to be thin. Aloo Masala is made by boiling potatoes in water and mashing them with black gram, spices, cashews, and ginger.</p>
