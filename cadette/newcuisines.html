	<h2>1. Make a dish from another country: Masala Dosas</h2>
	<p class="dates">March 19, 2021</p>
	
	<p>A dosa is like a flat, crispy pancake, originating from Southern India. A dosa can be eaten with a potato dish called Aloo Masala. A dosa is made by soaking rice, black gram (a type of bean), and fenugreek seeds in water and blending them until you get a smooth batter, and then frying it like a pancake. A dosa is supposed to be thin. Aloo Masala is made by boiling potatoes in water and mashing them with black gram, spices, cashews, and ginger.</p>

	<h2>2. Create a dish from another region of the United States: New Mexican Posole</h2>
	<p class="dates">April 3, 2021</p>

	<img src="newcuisines-posole.jpeg">

	<p>Posole is a stew from both Mexican and New Mexican cuisine. In Mexico, posole is served on New Year’s Eve, and on holidays throughout the year. Posole is made by boiling hominy, dry corn treated with alkali, until soft and chewy. Then, you cook it with chiles, spices, and meat (usually pork). It is served with chopped onion soaked in ice water, lime, and cilantro.</p>

	<p>Note: This dish was a little bland and quite meaty. I would suggest cutting the meat back by half and browning it a little bit before putting it in the pot.</p>

	<h2>3. Whip up a dish from another time period: Minutal of Apricots</h2>
	<p class="dates">October 4, 2021</p>

	<img src="minutal.png">

	<p>This dish was originally in a cookbook written in 900 AD, and cooked by the ancient Romans. It is a stew of pork in a type of sweet sauce with little bits of tracta, or thin flour crackers. I couldn’t find thin crackers to make this dish, so I used thin noodles instead.</p>
