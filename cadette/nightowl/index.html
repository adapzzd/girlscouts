		My family and I went to the ABQ BioPark Botanical Garden to look at the River of Lights. 
		There were a bunch of lights there, in all sorts of shapes and themes!
		For example, there was one section that had a bunch of hummingbirds and butterflies, and another that had a farm theme. It also had several light animations.
		
		I really liked seeing all of the light displays. My favorite one was the cheetah animation that leapt onto a rock.

	  I looked for Comet Leonard in the very early morning. I couldn't find it, but I did find Arcturus and where the comet was supposed to be.
		  
	  It was super hard to even find where it was supposed to be! When I looked there I couldn't see the comet. 
	  In the USA today article I read about it, it says anyone in the world can see it with some binoculars or a telescope.
	  One of the problems might have been all of the utility wires blocking the sky. It was also close to sunrise, so it may have been really dim.
	  Even though I didn't get to see the comet, it was still really fun to get up early and go stargazing!
		  
	  After looking for the comet, I watched a video on CNN that says the difference between comets, meteors, meteorites, and asteroids.
	  Here's what I learned:
		<ul>
			<li>Comets are pieces of frozen gas with dust and rocks in them.</li>
			<li>Asteroids are rocks, with hard surfaces. They come from the asteroid belt.</li>
			<li>Meteors are asteroids that hit the earth's atmosphere and burn up.</li>
			<li>Meteorites are asteroids that hit the earth. The ones that don't are called shooting stars.</li>
		</ul>
