<p>Girl Scout Badge: <strong>First Aid</strong></p>

	
	
	<h2>1. Talk about First Aid in a group</h2>
	<p class="dates">March 23, 2022</p>
	<p>Our troop talked about First Aid with Miss Michelle, an RN with Johnson City Schools. 
		We went over what to put in a First Aid kit (and how to use it), what the signs of 
		shock are, what you should do if you see someone who has been injured, and how to treat 
		injuries due to the weather.</p>

	<h2>2. Research injuries thet people participating in a particular outdoor sport sometimes get.</h2>
	<p class="dates">June 9, 2022</p>
	<p>Our troop leader gave us this requirement to complete on our own:</p>
	
	<p>Go online and research injuries suffered by people participating in an outdoor activity you enjoy, 
		such as canoeing, skiing, etc. Interview someone from a search-and-rescue squad or emergency 
		response unit about how they treat those injuries, how you can get help if someone is
		injured, and what to domwhile you're waiting for help to arrive.</p>
	
	<p>I chose archery as my outdoor sport (I'm working on <a href="https://apzzd.github.io/girlscouts/cadette/archery/">my archery badge</a>).
  <br><br>
  <strong>COMMON ARCHERY INJURIES</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>String slap (the bow string rubs against the arm holding the bow and gives the archer a sort of "rope burn")</li>
    <li>Puncture wounds (from getting hit by an arrow)</li>
    <li>Archer's elbow (strain on elbow because of a too heavy draw weight)</li>
    <li>Blisters (from fingers rubbing against string)</li>
  </ul>
  
	<br><br>
	I interviewed the EMS chief of my local fire department. I asked him about the listed injuries and what to do while waiting for help. Here are my notes:

	<br><br>
	To get help, call 911. While you're waiting, try to keep the patient comfortable and do the things below:
	<br><br>
	If someone gets hit with an arrow, <strong>do not pull the arrow out</strong>. Apply a dressing, try to control the 
	bleeding, and apply pressure to the wound.
	<br><br>
	If someone gets string slap, give them an ice pack with a cloth around it, and if it hurts really bad, 
	consider Tylenol. This is not a major injury.
	<br><br>
	If someone gets archer's elbow, tell them not to use that elbow for a while and ice it. If it is severe, use a sling.
	<br><br>
	If someone gets blisters, <strong>do not pop them</strong>. Cover them with tape or a Band-Aid. 
	If they are on the person's feet, have them wear socks and a Band-Aid, and if they are on their hands, 
	try to keep them covered. When they pop, try to keep them clean.
