<p>Girl Scout Name:</p>
<p>Girl Scout Badge: <strong>Cadette First Aid</strong></p>

<p><strong>Girls must complete one activity from each of the 5 Steps of the badge.</strong></p>
	
	<h2>1. Talk about First Aid in a group</h2>
	<p class="dates">March 23, 2022</p>
	<p>Our troop talked about First Aid with Miss Michelle, an RN with Johnson City Schools. We went over what to put in a First Aid kit (and how to use it), what the signs of shock are, what you should do if you see someone who has been injured, and how to treat injuries due to the weather.</p>

  <h2>2. Research injuries thet people participating in a particular outdoor sport sometimes get.</h2>
	<p class="dates">Still working on it</p>
	I chose archery as my outdoor sport (I'm working on <a href="https://apzzd.github.io/girlscouts/cadette/archery/">my archery badge</a>).
  <br><br>
  <strong>COMMON ARCHERY INJURIES</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>String slap (the bow string rubs against the arm holding the bow and gives the archer a sort of "rope burn")</li>
    <li>Puncture wounds (from getting hit by an arrow)</li>
    <li>Archer's elbow (strain on elbow because of a too heavy draw weight)</li>
    <li>Blisters (from fingers rubbing against string)</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <strong>Who should I interview?</strong>
   <ul>
    <li>Park ranger or archery range owner</li>
    <li>Family doctor</li>
  </ul> 
  <strong>Questions</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>What should I do until help arrives?</li>
    <li>What should be in my first aid kit?</li>
    <li>How could I treat one of the more minor injuries? (blisters, string slap)</li>
  </ul>
