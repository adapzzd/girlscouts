<p>Girl Scout Badge: <strong>Archery</strong></p>

<p><strong>Girls must complete one activity from each of the 5 Steps of the badge.</strong></p>
	
	<h2>1. Get to know archery equipment</h2>
	<p class="dates">April 28, 2022</p>
 		
	<strong>Parts and types of bows</strong> - I learned the parts of compound and recurve bows (riser, limbs, cam, string, cable rod, and cable slide for a compound; just a riser, limbs, arrow rest, and string for a recurve)
	<br><br>
	<strong>Parts and types of arrows</strong> - I learned the parts of an arrow (fletching, shaft, nock, tip)
	<br><br>
	I also learned about what type of bow is best for me - a light recurve, with a 15 - 20 pound pull weight; also that arrows with feathered fletching fly the straightest on recurve bows.

	<h2>2. Learn about archery safety</h2>
	<p class="dates">April 11, 2022</p>
  		I went to Hit or Miss Archery Center. There, they sound a bell when you can retreive your arrows, and call out "clear" when everyone is done shooting, and you're not supposed to shoot while the red light is on. I wore shorts and a t-shirt, so nothing got caught up while I was shooting.

	<h2>3. Practice archery before you go on a range</h2>
		<p class="dates">April 11, 2022</p>
	
		I went to Hit or Miss Archery Center and got lessons from an instructor. We covered stance, grip, pullback, and how to nock an arrow. I used a compound bow.
	
		I went to Hit or Miss Archery Center a second time and got lessons from an instructor. We covered how to judge the distance to a target, how to shoot accurately, and how to score. I tried shooting a panther (not real) to see how far off the target I needed to aim to hit where I was shooting. We also covered the steps of getting ready to shoot. I used a recurve bow, and it was harder to pull back the string, but I liked it more than the compound bow.
