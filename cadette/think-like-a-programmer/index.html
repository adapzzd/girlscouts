	<h2>1. Find out how programmers use computational thinking to solve problems</h2>
	<p class="dates">March 2, 2022 - March 14, 2022</p>
	<br>
	Computational thinking is a way of thinking about things step-by-step. When you use computational thinking, you break 		things down and think about the problem in small parts. It’s sort of like thinking about doing something like you were 		programming a computer to do it.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)
	<br><br>
	For example, let’s think about making a sandwich. If you thought about how to make one and don’t use computational 		thinking, you lose a lot of precision and aren’t as specific about what to do.  Here’s what it might look like if you 		wrote out how to make a sandwich without thinking computationally: 
	
	<ol>
		<li>Get a slice of bread out of a bag.</li>
		<li>Spread peanut butter on it.</li>
		<li>Spread jelly on it.</li>
		<li>Put another slice of bread on it.</li>
	</ol>
