	<strong>What is computational thinking?</strong>
	<br><br>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">Wikipedia: Computational Thinking</a>
	<br><br>
	Computational thinking is the process of breaking up a problem you don't know how to solve or a process you don't know how to complete into bits that you do know how to complete.
	<br><br>
	<strong>How can I think computationally?</strong>
	<br><br>
	All you have to do is turn a complex task into a list of short, easy tasks. For example, how to make a sandwich:
	<br><br>
	<strong>To make a sandwich:</strong>
	<ol>
	
		<li>Find and open a bag of bread.</li>
		<li>Take out two slices of bread and lay them side by side.</li>
		<li>Find a butterknife. Place it next to the bread.</li>
		<li>Find a jar of peanut butter and open it.</li>
		<li>Find a jar of jelly and open it.</li>
		<li>Scoop jelly from the jelly jar and spread it on a bread slice.</li>
		<li>Scoop peanut butter from the peanut butter jar and spread it on a bread slice.</li>
		<li>Bring the two slices of bread together so that the peanut butter and jelly are facing inwards.</li>
	
	</ol>
	<br><br>
	There is another, less tedious way to think computationally. You can break your problem up into 3 simple steps:
	<ol>
	
		<li></li>
	
	</ol>
