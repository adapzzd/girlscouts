	<h2>1. Find out how programmers use computational thinking to solve problems</h2>
	<p class="dates">March 2, 2022 - March 14, 2022</p>
	<br>
	Computational thinking is a way of thinking about things step-by-step. When you use computational thinking, you break things down and think about the problem in small parts. It‚Äôs sort of like thinking about doing something like you were programming a computer to do it.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)
	<br><br>
	For example, let‚Äôs think about making a sandwich. If you thought about how to make one and don‚Äôt use computational thinking, you lose a lot of precision and aren‚Äôt as specific about what to do.  Here‚Äôs what it might look like if you wrote out how to make a sandwich without thinking computationally: 
	<br><br>
		1.	Get a slice of bread out of a bag.
	<br>
		2.	Spread peanut butter on it.
	<br>
		3.	Spread jelly on it.
	<br>
		4.	Put another slice of bread on it.

	<br><br>
	Also, look at this video to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWe4iohhmIw">see some people making PB&Js without thinking computationally</a>.
	<br><br>
	So, you can see that it is harder and more tedious to think about something computationally, but it pays off when the task is done correctly.
	<br><br>
	There are 4 parts to computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, generalization, and algorithms.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Decomposition</strong>
	<br><br>
	‚ÄúDecomposition in computer science, also known as factoring, is breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, program, and maintain.‚Äù (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science))
	<br><br>
	We can decompose the process of making a PB&J into these steps:
	<br><br>
		1.	Untie the bread bag.
	<br>
		2.	Reach in and pull out one slice of bread.
	<br>
		3.	Set the bread down.
	<br>
		4.	Open a jar of peanut butter by twisting the lid to the left.
	<br>
		5.	Pick a butter knife up.
	<br>
		6.	Hold the handle of the knife.
	<br>
		7.	Scoop peanut butter out of the jar with the blade of the knife.
	<br>
		8.	Spread the peanut butter that is on the blade of the knife on the slice of bread.
	<br>
		9.	Put the butter knife down. 
	<br>
		10.	Open a jar of jelly by twisting the lid to the left.
	<br>
		11.	Pick a butter knife up.
	<br>
		12.	Hold the handle of the knife.
	<br>
		13.	Scoop jelly out of the jar with the blade of the knife.
	<br>
		14.	Spread the jelly that is on the blade of the knife on the peanut butter.
	<br>
		15.	Reach in the bread bag and pull out one slice of bread.
	<br>
		16.	Set the bread down on top of the jelly.
	<br><br>
	These steps have to be precise, or the result might not turn out the way you want it to.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Pattern recognition</strong>
	<br><br>
	‚ÄúPattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data."(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition)
<br><br>
	If we adapt our process for making a PB&J, called an algorithm, we find that we can use it to make different types of sandwiches, like ham and cheese or pickle and mayonnaise. We can recognize a pattern between all of these different algorithms: we use bread, have some sort of condiments, and all of the ingredients are stacked on top of one another.
<br><br>
	When we make an algorithm that describes how to make a sandwich, there are usually some things in common that we use. These things that we manipulate are called data. In the PB&J example, the data is the bread, peanut butter, jelly, butter knife, and jars. (Remember, just because the knife and jars don‚Äôt go into the sandwich doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not used!)
	<br><br>
	
	<strong>Generalization </strong>
	
	<br><br>
	
	‚ÄúGeneralization can also be used to refer to the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole.‚Äù (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization)
	<br><br>
	This definition can be a bit tricky, so think about it this way: a generalization of something is the group it belongs to. For example, ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù is a generalization on both ‚ÄúPB&J‚Äù and ‚Äúham and cheese sandwich‚Äù. Also, ‚Äúcondiment‚Äù is the generalization of both ‚Äúpeanut butter‚Äù and ‚Äújelly‚Äù. 
	<br><br>
	Now that we know the steps that are used when making any kind of sandwich, and some data that is usually used, we can start to generalize. Here‚Äôs a generalization of how to make a sandwich:
	<br><br>
		1. Untie the bread bag.
	<br>
		2. Reach in and pull out one slice of bread.
	<br>
		3. Set the bread down.
	<br>
		4. Open the container of a condiment.
	<br>
		5. Put the condiment on top of the bread or preceding condiment.
	<br>
		6. Continue until all condiments are used.	
	<br>
		7. Reach in and pull out one slice of bread.
	<br>
		8. Set the bread down on top of the last condiment.
	<br><br>
	We turn ‚Äúpeanut butter‚Äù and ‚Äújelly‚Äù into ‚Äúcondiment‚Äù when we generalize it, because peanut butter and jelly are types of condiments.
	<br><br>
	This is a pretty general algorithm that describes how to make any type of sandwich. This is not as general as it could be, but still pretty simple.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Algorithm</strong>
	<br><br>
	‚ÄúIn mathematics and computer science, an algorithm...is a finite sequence of well defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.‚Äù (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)
	<br><br>
	In other words, it‚Äôs a really specific list of things you have to do to get a certain result.
	<br><br>
	The last algorithm we wrote was a pretty good example of one you would use when telling someone who has no idea how to make a sandwich how to make one (an alien, perhaps). We could generalize this even further, like if we wanted to make a 	breakfast sandwich with pancakes instead of bread, or a pita wrap by putting chicken and vegetables inside an opened slice of pita bread. (A pita wrap is a sandwich, right?)
	<br><br>
	So, now you can use this algorithm to make a sandwich to test it. But make sure you follow it like a computer, and look for exceptions - you might find something that isn‚Äôt specific enough. Try to act like the people in the YouTube video that you saw earlier.

	<h2>2A. Do 3 computational thinking activities: categorize various objects as ‚ÄúComputer‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot a Computer‚Äù to explore the four tasks that define a computer,...</h2>
	<p class="dates">March 22, 2022</p>
	
	A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer). A computer must have both a CPU (central processing unit) and a memory.
	
	<strong>Let's sort a list of things into the groups COMPUTER and NOT A COMPUTER.</strong>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Laptop (computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>digital electronic machine</li>
		<li>programmable</li>
		<li>CPU</li>
		<li>Memory</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Radio (not a computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>electronic machine</li>
	</ul>
	Note: A radio isn't a computer, but most radios have computers in them. They use the computers to do things like save favorite stations or find all of the active stations.
	
	<h3>Cellphone (computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>digital electronic machine</li>
		<li>programmable</li>
		<li>CPU</li>
		<li>Memory</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Music machine (not a computer)</h3> 
	<img src="music-machine.jpg" width="400">
	<ul>
		<li>machine</li>
		<li>programmable</li>
		<li>memory</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Pop-up toaster oven (not a computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>electronic machine</li>
		<li>programmable</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Automobile (not a computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>machine (this could be electronic if you have a battery-powered car)</li>
	</ul>
	Note: This is a description of a super-basic car. Modern cars usually have little computers in them (like a cruise control, rearview camera, etc.)
	
	<h3>Broom (not a computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>Brooms are stupid and are not even machines. üßπ</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Calculator (computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>digital electronic machine</li>
		<li>programmable</li>
		<li>CPU</li>
		<li>Memory<li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Smartwatch (computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>digital electronic machine</li>
		<li>programmable</li>
		<li>CPU</li>
		<li>Memory</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Wheelbarrow (not a computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>machine (but very basic)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Bicycle (not a computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>machine (may be electronic if you have a battery-powered bicycle)</li>
		<li>programmable (does a gearshift count?)</li>
		<li>Memory (see above comment)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Electric razor (computer)</h3> 
	<ul>
		<li>electronic machine</li>
	</ul>
	Note: If you have a super high-tech razor, then this is probably inaccurate.
