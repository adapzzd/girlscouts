  <strong>These are just notes I took on the fly while participating in this class. Probably not the most descriptive notes ever ðŸ˜‰</strong>
  
  Wireframe before you write code for an app - make a model of the app first that plans out pages or buttons and test your design with others, and then code it.

It is important that your app looks good, because users might not care how functional it is, just how good it looks.

Write a love letter to your favorite app or website! What do you like about it? The sappier the better ðŸ’• 

~ My Love Letter ~

Dear Merriam-Webster,

Your simple, honest home screen always appears in my dreams. When I'm lonely, the first thought I have is of you, my dear. You entertain me with your delightful word games and quizzes, and enlighten me with your perfect definitions and synonyms. If I am writing an essay or even just an ornate email, I will always know who to turn to. Even dictionary.com is no match for you, beloved. I shall never love another dictionary, and never consult another for the perfect adjective.

Do you remember the time when I had nothing to do, and you suggested the "Name that Feeling" quiz? I didn't even have to look at the question, I knew the answer was adoration.

My heart aches until we meet again...

Your most amorous logophile,

Ada
