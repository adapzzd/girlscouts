  <strong>These are just notes I took on the fly while participating in this class. Probably not the most descriptive notes ever ðŸ˜‰</strong>

  It's a good idea to use Inspector (in a browser) to learn more about how a website is designed.

Make creative instructions on how to make a PB&J. âœ¨ðŸ¥ªâœ¨
  <br><br>

~ My Instructions ~
<br><br>
So, you need to find the perfect instructions on how to make the best possible PB&J? Look no further!
<br><br>
1. Take three large slices of bread and put them all on a large plate.
2. Spread a generous amount of raspberry jam on two of the three slices.
3. Then, spread some almond butter on those two slices (feel free to add some crispy fried bacon if you're feeling adventurous).
4. Stack the two slices with toppings, and then put the plain slice of bread on top.
5. Cut in half diagonally.
<br><br>
And there you have it! A triple-decker, almond butter and raspberry jam sandwich (possibly with bacon). Enjoy!
