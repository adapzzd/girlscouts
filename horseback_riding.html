<h2>1. Know the basics of horseback riding</h2>
<p class="dates">May 9, 2021 - May 15, 2021</p>
<p>I checked out a whole bunch of encyclopedias at the library about horse care, and read about</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What a horse should eat</li>
		<li>How to groom a horse</li>
		<li>How to ride a horse</li>
		<li>What you should wear when riding a horse</li>
		<li>What to put on a horse before riding</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The best book I found was The Horse Riding and Care Handbook by Bernadette Faurie. </p>

<h2>2. Take care of a horse and learn about safety</h2>
<p class="dates">June 3, 2021</p>
<p>My troop and I went to Misty Mountain Stables to learn how to muck out stalls and how to put a bridle, saddle, etc. on a horse before riding, and also took a short ride.</p>

<h2>4. Practice your ride</h2>
